compiler/ must be deterministic:
- no network calls
- no LLM calls
- no database writes

LLM calls only allowed in inference/

Persistence only allowed in:
- db/
- storage/

Every feasibility run must write artifacts to:
frozen_runs/<run_id>/

Always add tests in tests/ when adding functionality.

Never mix compiler logic with API logic.
